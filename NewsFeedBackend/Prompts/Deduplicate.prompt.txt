Given a list of articles (JSON below as `articles`), group near-duplicates (same/very similar story) and pick a canonical representative per group.

articles: {{$articlesJson}}

Return STRICT JSON ONLY, minified:
{
  "groups": [
    { "canonicalUrl": "...", "members": ["...","...", "..."], "reason": "same story/near-identical title" }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Every input article.url must appear in exactly one group's "members".
- Keep reasons short.
