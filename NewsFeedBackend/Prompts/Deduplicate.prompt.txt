Given a list of articles that may be duplicates (same story from multiple sites),
group near-duplicates and pick a canonical representative per group.

Input: articles: [{ url, title, source }]
Output STRICT JSON ONLY:
{
  "groups": [
    { "canonicalUrl": "...", "members": ["...","...", "..."], "reason": "same story/near-identical title" },
    ...
  ]
}
- Every input url must appear in exactly one group's "members".
- Minify output. No markdown.
