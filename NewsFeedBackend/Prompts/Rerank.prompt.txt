Task: Given a user spec and a list of candidate news items, score each item for relevance and usefulness. Output STRICT JSON ONLY: an array of items.

Input will include:
- spec: { IncludeKeywords[], ExcludeKeywords[], PreferredSources[], Category?, TimeWindow? }
- articles: array of { url, title, source, publishedAt (ISO 8601), summary? }

Rules:
- Score in [0,1]. Higher is better.
- Penalize excluded keywords and non-preferred sources.
- If TimeWindow is set, prefer more recent items inside it.
- Keep array length = number of inputs (one output per article), same order.
- No markdown, no explanations outside JSON.

Output (JSON array):
[
  { "url": "...", "score": 0.72, "reason": "matches AI + within 7d + preferred source", "keep": true },
  ...
]
Minify output.
